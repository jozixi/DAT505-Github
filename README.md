# DAT505-Github
This is **Zixi Zhou**'s project.

## In section1
There are two folders in it. One of them is the `examples` and the another one is the file `practices and homework` including two projects which were completed in the class and my own homework after class.
* **01-testX**—— is to change the geometry's shape into a circular cone.

* **02-test** —— is to make two cubes which being tied together,like two clock hands.

* **S1-homework-creative project** —— I used two basic polyhedrons and changed their colors,sizes and rotation speeds.

## In section2
* **S2-01_Exercise-GeometriesAndMaterials** —— is to create different materials for the cubes.

* **S2-homework-composition** —— I have designed a composition with three different geometrical objects(cube,torus and pie) and used different textures.

## In section3
* **01-exercise_BasicGUI** —— This project is to set up the GUI controller to change the cube's scale,position,rotation,color and boxOpacity.

* **01-exercise-test** —— This is an exercise is to set up the GUI controller to change the cube's scale,position and rotation with more details.

* **S3-homework-geometric design** —— I used the squares and circles to make a two dimensional geometrical design. The kinds of geometries are simple,but the pattern is complex.

## In section4
* **S4-ArrayMesh** —— It is to change the cubes color in different areas.

* **S4-homework-cubes with different speeds and rotations** —— This work is to create continuous rotations for each cube independently(different rotation and speed).

## In section5
* **S5-ArrayMesh-Exercise** —— In this project, the cubes on the specified positions can change into random colors while the others are grey and the scale of the cube is keeping changing in a range. In general it looks like a wave.

## In section6
* **S6-01-CityScape-full-exercise** —— I changed the building into a  wireframe looking and the color is influenced by the environment.

## In section7
* **S7-01-Texture-Cube** —— In this project,the cubes can fall down from the top of the window in random shapes and textures.

* **S7-03-Texture-Eyes-Interaction** —— In this project, it will create random number eyes in random positions and they can rotate towards the same direction.

## In section8
* **S8-00-Texture-Eyes-Interaction2X** —— is the project that five eyes can turn towards to the mouse's direction at the same time.
![screenshot](screenshots/s8-eyes interaction2.jpg)

* **S8-01-RaycastSprite** —— is the project that the box can change to the random colors when you move the mouse on shapes.
![screenshot](screenshots/S8-01-RaycastSprite.jpg)

* **S8-02-objLoader-Raycasting** —— is the project that imported my own model(drones) and they can change the colors when clicking it.

## In section9
* **S9-01-RaycastAudio** —— The model in this project is the same as that of S8-02, but it has an Audio(the sound of the drones).
