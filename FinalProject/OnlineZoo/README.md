This is an audiovisual interactive composition. It is supposed to do the popularization of science for the users even the kids and let them know more about the Bio-diversity. I have designed a scene which is a zoo. It is divided into five plates, they are tundra, island, jungle, forest and farm, Different plates have different animals on them. I tried to use 3d models to bring users a feeling of being personally on the scene. This could enhance  the interest of the project and help users to remember the content better.

First of all, there’s a loading interface. Then there will appear a button” Click to play”. After you click it, the background music will be played and there will has a main scene. This scene is consisted by 5 different landforms. The camera will do an auto rotate, in order to show the scene all-round. On the top of the screen is a tips” You can click the animals.”. After clicking the animals ,there will have a label which is the animal’s name and a sentence of introduction  will appear on the top right-hand corner. The scene will always rotate and the users can repeat clicking to know the information of other ones.

My originality was came up with my daily life. One day I went to the zoo with my friends. There were lots of children there . I found that the price of ticket is expensive. Maybe not all the familes could afford it if they want go there for times ,so I decided to design an online zoo. It could help a lot of people to see different kinds of animals with no cost.

My project has 6 folders. File `Audio` contains the background music. `css` contains a css file. File `gltf` contains the 3d models. File `img` contains the models' textures. File `js` contains codes files.`play.js` is the most important one. File `screenshots` contains 4 different images of my final screen composition.
Code's comments are in the file`play.js`

Please open file`indexModel.html` to play this project.
